## Description 
```
The purpose of our application is to merge two seperate API's (Application Program Interface) so the user can have access to detailed information, from the movie/tv show over-scope down to the very song that stood out to them.
```
## Proposal
```
Most streaming websites allow their users to watch select tv shows and movies. But an element that most of these websites lack are a musical aspect. By integrating movie/tv show api with the well known spotify api, we want to allow users to find the album from said movie/tvshow. We plan for the users easy accessability to info on their favorite cinematics down to the music for an in depth interaction.
