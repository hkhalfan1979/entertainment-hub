## Description 
```
Most apps these days provide a feed to its user that they can further customize. Having so many applications makes it difficult to see all the information at once. The purpose of our application is to merge all each seperate API's (Application Program Interface) so the user can curate their feed in one place. For this project we want to have the user easily find movies they're interested in and its corresponding sound track. IF TIME PERMITS we will ATTEMPT to also add tv shows :) so netflix but better because we have MUSSSSIQUE.
